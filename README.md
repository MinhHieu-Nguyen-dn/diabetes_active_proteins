#Predict compounds interaction with diabetes target proteins: SGLT2 and AR.  

[Drugs/Proteins Discovery] Predict if an input compound activates **Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 (SGLT2)** and **Aldose Reductase (AR)** as an inhibitor to decrease/block activity of these proteins.

## Outcome of the project:
- User input: A compound or a list of compounds (format: SMILES).  
- Output: Result with active/non-active labels corresponding to the interaction of each compound to SGLT2 and AR.
